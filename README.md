#	Solution Manual For Statistic For Applications (MIT)



### Instruction
This is a Solution Manual for the famous course from MIT [Statistic For Application](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/index.htm).

The Manual is written in LaTex, and I do not omit other files generated by Tex, so that not only you can  view the pdf file for solution but also others file generated by Tex. I will keep update the solutions as my learning process goes on.

There are some problems that I am not sure, which have been marked by "Waiting for update" in the solution manual. If you want to provide a solution for these unsolving problems, have any question, or come up with better ideas about any problem in the manual, please feel free to contact with me <nhoang0708@gmail.com>

I want to address several issues here: (1) Currently I still do not get the permission of Prof. Philippe Rigollet to upload this solution manual online. Therefore, maybe I will withdraw this solution maunal someday if it becomes illegal. (2) This solution manual is only meant to be used as personal study reference, **please do not take it for other purposes, e.g., upload to other websites or publications**.
